I aspire to work with computers in the future, technology has always been a passion of mine, ever since I was a kid and got to mess around on my old family computer. Outside of school I like rock climbing and video games, and spend a lot of time with my close friends. Thanks for checking out my ePortfolio, and I hope it gives you a glimpse of who I am and where I’m heading. You can find more information on the classes I've taken, a deeper look into my goals, my resume, and my skills. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect — I’m always excited to meet people who share my interests and goals!

                        I grew up with a strong passion for technology and problem-solving. From a young age, I was fascinated by how things worked, which led me to pursue a degree in Computer Information Systems. Through my academic journey, I’ve developed skills in programming, web development, and data analysis.
